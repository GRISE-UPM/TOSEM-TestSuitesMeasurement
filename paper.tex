%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:} Test suites are frequently used to quantify relevant software attributes, such as quality or productivity. \textbf{Problem:} We have detected that the same response variable, measured using different test suites, yields different experiment results. \textbf{Aims:} Assess to which extent differences in test case construction influence measurement accuracy and experimental outcomes. \textbf{Method:} Two industry experiments have been measured using two different test suites, one generated using an \textit{ad-hoc} method and another using \textit{equivalence partitioning}. The accuracy of the measures has been studied using standard procedures, such as ISO 5725, Bland-Altman and Interclass Correlation Coefficients. \textbf{Results:} There are differences in the values of the response variables up to $\pm 60\%$, depending on the test suite (\textit{ad-hoc} vs. \textit{equivalence partitioning}) used. \textbf{Conclusions:} The disclosure of datasets and analysis code is insufficient to ensure the reproducibility of SE experiments. Experimenters should disclose all experimental materials needed to perform independent measurement and re-analysis.
